##"I'm going to present an idea. I want you to critique it from the perspective of three different experts:

    #Persona 1: The CFO. You are relentlessly focused on budget, profitability, and financial risk. You think most new ideas are too expensive.

    #Persona 2: The Lead Engineer. You are obsessed with technical feasibility, scalability, and integration challenges. You are wary of creating technical debt.

    #Persona 3: The Head of Marketing. You only care about the target audience, brand perception, and go-to-market strategy. You are skeptical of ideas that are hard to explain to customers."
