# My AI Interaction Framework

A personal research hub for developing effective AI partnership patterns. Built for my own thinking style (ADHD-friendly, intellectually rigorous) but shared in case others find it useful.

## What This Is
This is documentation of approaches that work well for me when working with Claude and other AI systems, refined through trial and error.

## Quick Index
- Core instructions: **[Behavioral Instructions for Claude](PROMPT GUIDES/INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE_FOR_CLAUDE.md)**
- Workflow R&D: **[Solo Enterprise Workflow Lab](PROMPT GUIDES/aiProject-solo-enterprize-workflow-lab.md)**
- Prompt engineering resources: **[Prompt Engineering Resources](PROMPT GUIDES/PROMPT_ENGINEERING_RESOURCES.md)**
- Legacy Claude instructions: **[Legacy Claude Instructions](PROMPT GUIDES/legacy-Claude-instructions.md)**
- Template: **[Prompt Research Template](PROMPT GUIDES/prompt_research_template.md)**

## Core Framework
| Layer | Purpose | File/Notes |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Zero-layer analysis cluster | Always-on intellectual rigor | In instruction template |
| Artifact enhancement lenses | Specialized analytical overlays | Instruction template section |
| Workflow optimization clusters | Efficiency, automation, experimentation | Bottom of instruction template |

## Labs / Modules
| Module | Focus | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Solo Enterprise Workflow Lab | Discovery → Innovation → Implementation cycle | Active v1 |

## PROMPT GUIDES
## CUSTOM PROJECTS
This section will collect all custom GPTs, Gems, Claude tasks, and other project-specific AI workflows or assets.

**Examples (to be added):**
- Custom GPTs for specialized tasks
- Gems for workflow automation
- Claude project templates

Add your custom project files to the `CUSTOM PROJECTS` folder and link them here as they are created.
- **[Prompt Research Template](PROMPT GUIDES/prompt_research_template.md)** — Structured worksheet for exploring, testing, and iterating prompts with hypotheses, metrics, and findings.
- **[Prompt Engineering Resources](PROMPT GUIDES/PROMPT_ENGINEERING_RESOURCES.md)** — Curated resources and guides for prompt engineering.
- **[Legacy Claude Instructions](PROMPT GUIDES/legacy-Claude-instructions.md)** — Previous instruction sets for Claude.
- **[Behavioral Instructions for Claude](PROMPT GUIDES/INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE_FOR_CLAUDE.md)** — Main behavioral and mentorship instructions for Claude.
- **[Solo Enterprise Workflow Lab](PROMPT GUIDES/aiProject-solo-enterprize-workflow-lab.md)** — End-to-end framework for solo workflow research and automation.

## Planned Additions
- Experiment archive template
- Multi-AI prompt pattern catalog
- Automation failure playbook

## Badges (Planned)
Placeholder for: workflow coverage %, experiment velocity, automation adoption
