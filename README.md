# My AI Interaction Framework

A personal research hub for developing effective AI partnership patterns. Built for my own thinking style (ADHD-friendly, intellectually rigorous) but shared in case others find it useful.

## What This Is
This is documentation of approaches that work well for me when working with Claude and other AI systems, refined through trial and error.

## Core Framework
- **[Behavioral Instructions for Claude](INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE_FOR_CLAUDE.md)** - My zero-layer and behavioral programming approach
- **Zero-layer analysis clusters** - Always-active intellectual foundations  
- **Artifact enhancement modules** - Specialized analytical lenses for specific tasks

## Project / Lab Modules
- **[Solo Enterprise Workflow Lab](aiProject-solo-enterprize-workflow-lab.md)** - End-to-end framework for discovering, designing, and iterating high-leverage solo workflows using multi-AI + automation lenses
