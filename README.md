# My AI Interaction Framework

A personal research hub for developing effective AI partnership patterns. Built for my own thinking style (ADHD-friendly, intellectually rigorous) but shared in case others find it useful.

## What This Is
This is documentation of approaches that work well for me when working with Claude and other AI systems, refined through trial and error.

## Quick Index
- Core instructions: **[Behavioral Instructions for Claude](INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE_FOR_CLAUDE.md)**
- Workflow R&D: **[Solo Enterprise Workflow Lab](aiProject-solo-enterprize-workflow-lab.md)**

## Core Framework
| Layer | Purpose | File/Notes |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Zero-layer analysis cluster | Always-on intellectual rigor | In instruction template |
| Artifact enhancement lenses | Specialized analytical overlays | Instruction template section |
| Workflow optimization clusters | Efficiency, automation, experimentation | Bottom of instruction template |

## Labs / Modules
| Module | Focus | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Solo Enterprise Workflow Lab | Discovery → Innovation → Implementation cycle | Active v1 |

## Planned Additions
- Experiment archive template
- Multi-AI prompt pattern catalog
- Automation failure playbook

## Badges (Planned)
Placeholder for: workflow coverage %, experiment velocity, automation adoption
