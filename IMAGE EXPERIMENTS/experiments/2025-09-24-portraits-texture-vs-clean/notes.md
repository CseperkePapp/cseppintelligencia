# Notes — 2025-09-24 — Portraits: Texture vs Clean

Models:
- Gemini: clean portraits, smoother skin, controlled lighting
- ChatGPT (DALL·E): rugged/textured looks, more grit and environmental character

Outcome:
- Confirmed: Gemini excels at polished, editorial look; ChatGPT delivers textured realism
- Constraint observed: ChatGPT refused when prompt included "mixing celebrity features" (safety). Reframed to non-celebrity descriptors; it proceeded.

Next:
- Test stability across seeds, verify consistency over 10 runs
- Add Midjourney comparison with same prompt framing
- Compile side-by-side grid for docs
	- See: [comparison.md](comparison.md)
