## Current Techniques (2025)
**Selected based on practical utility and recent developments**

### Defensive & Production Patterns
- **Prompt scaffolding** - Wrapping user inputs in structured templates for security
- **Context engineering** - Beyond prompts: RAG, JSON inputs, structured workflows
- **Model-specific optimization** - Different models need different formatting approaches

### Advanced Reasoning
- **Chain-of-thought with self-consistency** - Multiple reasoning paths, compare outcomes
- **Dynamic few-shot** - Select different examples based on input rather than fixed examples
- **Prompt chaining** - Sequential prompts for complex multi-step tasks

### Practical Applications
- **Temperature tuning** - 0 for factual, higher for creative tasks
- **Iterative refinement** - Systematic testing and improvement cycles
- **Cost optimization** - Prompt engineering as cost management tool
